# tdd-data-structs-and-algos-js

This is my playground for implementing a few data structures and algorithms using Javascript! Each implementation will be done using test-driven development, i.e.:

1) Before writing the code, write a minimal failing test.
2) Write a minimal amount of code to pass that test.
3) Refactor your code.
4) Repeat!

I am excited about this little project, as I recently attended a talk where I got my first real insight into TDD. 

I am hoping to cover the following items:<br>
Sorts: heap, merge, quick<br>
Structs: queue, heap, stack
